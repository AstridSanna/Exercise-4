# Exercise 4: Functions


The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand how to create and use functions in Python.
You will create a simple tool that converts temperatures from one kind of temperature scale to another and then classify those temperatures into specific temperature classes.

## Start working

### Problem 0 - Mid-term course feedback requested

Before you get started on the exercise, we'd like for you to take 5 minutes to provide us with some feedback on how the course is going so far. We would be very pleased to have your honest thoughts (positive or negative) about how things are going. Feedback is **completely anonymous**.

### Problems 1-3: Classifying and converting temperatures

**Start by cloning your personal exercise repository from GitHub. Always remember to push your latest changes to GitHub.** Step-by-step instructions for using Git and GitHub are available on [the course webpages](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L2/git-basics.html).
